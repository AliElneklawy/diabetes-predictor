# Diabetes Predictor
A binary classification model that can be used to predict wheter a patient is diabetic or not based on the following factors:
- Gender: it can have an impact on patients' susceptibility to diabetes.
- Age: it is an important factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults. Age ranges from 0-80 in our dataset.
- Hypertension: it is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.
- Heart disease: another medical condition that is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes.
- Smoking history: it is also considered a risk factor for diabetes and can exacerbate the complications associated with diabetes.
- BMI: Body Mass Index is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. Higher BMI values are linked to a higher risk of diabetes.
  The range of BMI in the dataset is from 10.16 to 71.55.
- HbA1c level: a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Higher levels indicate a greater risk of
  developing diabetes. Mostly more than 6.5% of HbA1c Level indicates diabetes.
- Blood glucose level: refers to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream at a given time. High blood glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.

The model has:
- Accuracy: 0.97
- Precision: 0.98
- Recall: 0.69
- F1-score: 0.82
- ROC AUC: 0.85
